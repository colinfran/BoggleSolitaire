Name of Game: Colin Franceschini's Amazing Boggle Game

Author: Colin Franceschini

Goal: The goal is to find as many words on the board as possible.

Game play techniques: The game will display random letters onto a grid. The game will then search
			the grid for words that can be found in the grid. If a word is found, the
			user accumulates points. The user has to move the letters of the grid to find words
			and accumulate enough points to win. They lose if  they use their remaining boards.

Swapping techniques: The user will need to input the row and colum of the letter that they want to move
			and then input the row or column they want to switch it with. The user can switch
			literally any of the letters in the grid with any other letter throughout the grid.

Word finding techniques: The game puts all the letters on the board into a string and will
			check if the letters in the string can make up a word and if it does, 
			it checks to see if the word in the grid is even a real word found in
			the dictionary.

Scoring algorithm: Each word counts as 10 points. User wants to get 100 points.

End game condition: Game never ends, unfortunately.

What works: almost everything

What doesn't work: The diagnol right direction.
